## Description

<aside class="alert"><strong>Deprecated:</strong> The HTTP 214 Transformation Applied status code and the Warning HTTP Header have been deprecated.</aside>

The HTTP `214 Transformation Applied` is an unofficial status code used in combination
with the [Warning HTTP header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Warning) and included with HTTP response messages to indicate
that a transformation has been applied to the representation.

This status code and `Warning` header MUST be added by a proxy if it applies any
transformation to the representation, such as changing the `content-coding`,
`media-type`, or modifying the representation data, unless the `Warning` header
already appears in the response.
